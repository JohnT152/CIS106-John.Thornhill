# CIS106-John.Thornhill
My name is John Thornhill, I am taking this course because I find computers interesting and how they work. And just like you said in the PowerPoint, the salary that comes with this path is very strong, and this helped a lot with my decision for this career. My hobbies include gaming so being at my computer for long periods of time is nothing new to me. While I have taken 2 years of Computer Science in the past, they were during my freshman and sophomore years in high school. I have a lot less knowledge on how to code than I did back then but I am very willing to learn. Unfortunately, I registered a little later this semester, so I ended up taking this online course, but that doesn't discourage me all that much. Using GitHub is very new to me, so hopefully I'll adjust quickly and be able to keep up in this course.
